Title:
PPI-OMEGA: Integrating Multi-Omics Data to Enhance Protein-Protein Interaction Predictions Using Variational Graph Autoencoders

Abstract:
Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are fundamental for understanding cellular processes, with implications in drug discovery, functional genomics, and disease research. However, existing computational models for PPI prediction face limitations, including reliance on static interaction data, exclusion of multi-omics information, and significant computational costs when applied to large-scale datasets.
To address these challenges, we introduce PPI-OMEGA (Protein-Protein Interaction with Omics-Enhanced Graph Autoencoder), a Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE)-based framework that integrates multi-omics data to improve PPI prediction. Our model incorporates RNA expression profiles and immunohistochemistry (IHC) protein expression levels as node attributes in a graph-based learning framework. Unlike conventional models, PPI-OMEGA captures both network topology and molecular context, learning biologically meaningful latent representations through graph convolutional layers and probabilistic embeddings.
To assess model performance, we conducted an ablation study, demonstrating that integrating multi-omics features significantly enhances prediction accuracy. The combined RNA and protein expression model achieved the highest AUROC (0.9235) and AP (0.9318), outperforming both RNA-only and protein-only models. Additionally, our analysis of latent representations revealed biological context awareness, as the model successfully distinguished between housekeeping and context-dependent proteins and exhibited structured convergence based on network connectivity.
PPI-OMEGA further reduces computational overhead by generating reusable embeddings, facilitating downstream applications such as disease association studies and functional classification. These findings highlight the potential of graph-based multi-omics integration for advancing PPI modeling and precision medicine applications.
