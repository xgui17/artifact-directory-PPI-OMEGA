Title:
PPI-OMEGA: Integrating Multi-Omics Data to Enhance Protein-Protein Interaction Predictions Using Variational Graph Autoencoders

Abstract:
Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are essential for understanding
molecular mechanisms governing biological systems, with applications in drug
discovery, functional genomics, and disease pathway identification. However,
existing computational approaches for predicting PPIs face limitations due to
their reliance on static interaction data, the absence of multi-omics integra-
tion, and significant computational costs when applied to large-scale biolog-
ical datasets. To address these challenges, we present PPI-OMEGA, a Vari-
ational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE)-based framework that integrates multi-
omics data to enhance PPI prediction. Our model combines RNA expression
profiles and immunohistochemistry (IHC) protein expression levels as node
attributes in a graph-based learning framework. The encoder in the model
architecture efficiently learns biologically meaningful protein embeddings by
leveraging graph convolutional layers, while the decoder reconstructs the PPI
network, capturing both network topology and molecular context.

To assess model performance, we benchmark our approach against traditional
PPI prediction methods and evaluate it using Area Under the Receiver Op-
erating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) and Average Precision (AP). Results
demonstrate that incorporating multi-omics data significantly improves pre-
dictive accuracy, with the RNA and protein expression-based model achieving the high-
est AUROC (0.9115) and AP (0.9198), outperforming RNA-only and protein-only
models. Moreover, our framework reduces computational overhead
by generating reusable embeddings that facilitate downstream tasks such as
disease association studies and functional classification. These findings high-
light the potential of graph-based multi-omics integration to improve disease-
relevant PPI modeling and support precision medicine applications.
